# Homebrew formula for carveai-bridge — the CarveAI desktop file-access daemon.
#
# Users install with one of:
#
#   brew install CarveAI/tap/bridge        # short form
#   brew tap CarveAI/tap && brew install bridge
#
# The bridge daemon is a self-contained Go static binary (~5 MB) compiled
# for darwin-arm64, darwin-amd64, linux-arm64, linux-amd64. Source lives
# in the private CarveAI/carveai-core repo under bridge/; binaries are
# mirrored to this tap repo's releases on every `bridge-vX.Y.Z` tag by
# carveai-core's release workflow.
#
# Updating this formula on a new release is automated by that workflow;
# manual edits aren't required for routine version bumps.
